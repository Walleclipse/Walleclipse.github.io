My first serious programming project: a fully-featured Reversi (Othello) game in C++. It includes a GUI, save/load functionality, online multiplayer, and AI opponents powered by Alpha-Beta pruning, iterative deepening, and transposition tables. The AI consistently ranked in the top 10% on competitive platforms—a formative experience that sparked my interest in intelligent systems.

[//]: # (The AI bot ranked among the top 10% in both the Reversi and Ataxx competitions, the top 5% in the Gomoku competition, and the top 3% in the Renju competition on the <a href="https://www.botzone.org.cn/">Botzone</a> online multi-agent competitive platform.)
