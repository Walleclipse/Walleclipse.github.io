This is a C++-based Reversi (Othello) program featuring a graphical user interface (GUI). 
It supports functionalities such as saving and loading games, online multiplayer, and AI battles. 
The AI is implemented using Alpha-Beta Pruning, Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search, and a Translation Table for enhanced performance.
