What happens when you combine the best of two worlds—pre-trained models from one domain and a mix of labeled and unlabeled data from another? We developed Adaptive Consistency Regularization to answer that question. The key insight: not all unlabeled samples are equally useful for transfer. Our method intelligently selects which examples to regularize, squeezing maximum value from limited supervision while respecting what the source model already knows.
