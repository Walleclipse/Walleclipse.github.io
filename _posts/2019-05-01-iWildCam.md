In this work, we propose an efficient method for categorizing animals in the wild. To enhance the model's generalization and robustness, 
we employ advanced image augmentation and regularization strategies, including cutout, mixup, and label smoothing. Additionally, we utilize 
ensemble learning to further boost model performance. By leveraging these advanced regularization techniques and ensemble learning, 
our approach secured a top 7/336 placement in the iWildCam 2019 competition, held as part of CVPR 2019.
