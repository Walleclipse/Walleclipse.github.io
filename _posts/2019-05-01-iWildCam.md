Camera traps capture millions of wildlife images—but who's going to classify them all? Our solution combines smart data augmentation (cutout, mixup, label smoothing) with ensemble learning to robustly identify animals in challenging, real-world conditions. This approach earned us 7th place out of 336 teams (top 2%) in the iWildCam 2019 Challenge at CVPR.
