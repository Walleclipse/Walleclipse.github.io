This work demonstrates sub-ps resolution clock-offset measurement using linear optical sampling with dual optical frequency combs over a 114 km fiber link, achieving a time deviation of 110 fs at 1 s and 22 fs at 100 s averaging. This advance supports precise time synchronization in long fiber link applications.
