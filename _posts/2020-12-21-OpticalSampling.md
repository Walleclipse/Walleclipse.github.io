Synchronizing clocks over long distances with sub-picosecond precision sounds impossible—until you use optical frequency combs. We demonstrated linear optical sampling with dual combs over a 114 km fiber link, achieving an astonishing 110 femtoseconds timing deviation at 1 second and just 22 femtoseconds at 100 seconds of averaging. This opens doors for ultra-precise timing applications in telecommunications and fundamental physics.
