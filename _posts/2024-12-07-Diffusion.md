This paper proposes a novel method to enhance diffusion model sample generation by aligning noise level estimates with the true distance to the underlying manifold. A noise level correction network refines estimates during denoising, compatible with any scheduler (e.g., DDIM), and extends to image restoration tasks like inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing.
