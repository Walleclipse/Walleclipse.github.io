Motion prediction powers everything from self-driving cars to collaborative robots—but why do models that ace benchmarks often struggle in the real world? This comprehensive survey digs into that gap. We examine the state of motion prediction across robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion analysis, revealing where current approaches fall short of deployment-ready performance. More importantly, we chart a path forward with concrete strategies for building predictors that actually generalize beyond test sets.
