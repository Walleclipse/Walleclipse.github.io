To enable transfer learning in semi-supervised settings, we propose a hierarchical self-regularization mechanism that enhances 
the utilization of unlabeled samples. This approach introduces a novel self-regularizer, combining individual-level and population-level 
regularization terms. The samples contributing to both regularizers are weighted using an adaptive strategy, where the self-regularization 
effects are dynamically adjusted based on each sample's confidence. 
Additionally, the proposed self-regularization enhances performance also in fully-supervised and self-supervised settings.
