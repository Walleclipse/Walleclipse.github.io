Certified training promises neural networks that are provably robust—but at what cost? We found that existing methods over-regularize, crippling the model's performance. The culprit: unstable neurons with high variance. Borrowing intuition from signal processing, we introduce Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) inspired loss functions that tame this variance without sacrificing what the network actually learned. The result is robustness you can trust, with accuracy you can use.
