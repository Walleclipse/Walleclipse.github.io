This work tackles the over-regularization issue in certified training methods by introducing the concepts of neuron variance and 
neuron stability, analyzing their roles in over-regularization and model robustness. To address this challenge, we extend the 
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) framework to the domain of model robustness, providing a fresh perspective. Additionally, we develop 
SNR-inspired loss functions designed to  mitigate over-regularization while  enhancing robustness.
