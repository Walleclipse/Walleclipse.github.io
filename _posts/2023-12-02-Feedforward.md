This work proposes an online adaptation method with feedforward compensation that optimizes the prediction model using critical data samples 
from a memory buffer rather than relying solely on the latest samples. We demonstrate that this approach achieves a smaller error bound 
compared to previously used methods in slow time-varying systems, enhancing both accuracy and robustness.
