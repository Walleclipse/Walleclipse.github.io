The successful deployment of intelligent robots in dynamic, real-world environments demands the ability to learn continually from streaming dataâ€”a capability that remains beyond the reach of conventional machine learning. This thesis studies three fundamental barriers to achieving this goal: catastrophic forgetting, severe data inefficiency in robotic learning, and the challenge of adaptively modeling and controlling complex nonlinear dynamics from limited experience.
