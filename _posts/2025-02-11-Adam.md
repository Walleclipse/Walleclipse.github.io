Adam is everywhere in deep learning, but its default initialization has a subtle flaw that hurts generalization. We traced the problem to the second-order moment estimate starting at zero—a seemingly innocent choice with real consequences. Simple fixes like data-driven or random initialization yield meaningful performance gains. Sometimes the biggest improvements come from revisiting the basics.
