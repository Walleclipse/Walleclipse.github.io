Predicting what a human will do next is crucial for safe human-robot collaboration—but people are unpredictable, and models trained offline quickly become stale. We built an online adaptation framework combining Extended Kalman Filtering with exponential moving average smoothing and dynamic multi-epoch updates. The result: neural networks that continuously refine their predictions using real-time feedback, staying accurate even as human behavior evolves.
