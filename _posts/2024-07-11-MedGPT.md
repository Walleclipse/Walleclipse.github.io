This study aims to enhance GPT-4’s domain-specific expertise by employing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, 
which integrates up-to-date, evidence-based knowledge into GPT-4’s foundational database. 
Additionally, we plan to explore the use of commonly used automatic evaluation metrics in natural language processing, such as BERT score, 
BLEURT, and cosine similarity, alongside human evaluation, to develop a semi-automatic framework. 
This aims to reduce dependency on exhaustive human evaluations, addressing the need for efficient and scalable assessment tools in medical 
decision-making.
