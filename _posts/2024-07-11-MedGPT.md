Can GPT-4 help cardiologists make better decisions? We put it to the test in cardiac electrophysiology—a complex specialty where AI assistance could really matter. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we boosted GPT-4's domain expertise with evidence-based medical knowledge. But evaluating AI in medicine is tricky, so we also developed a semi-automatic framework combining metrics like BERT score with physician assessments. The result: a practical pathway for deploying AI in clinical decision support.
