This paper addresses online adaptable multi-task prediction for both intention and trajectory. 
The objective is to enhance the performance of both predictions using only feedback from observed trajectories. 
To achieve this, we integrate the EKF with exponential moving average filtering and a dynamic multi-epoch update strategy, 
resulting in improved prediction accuracy.
