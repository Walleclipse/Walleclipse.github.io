This paper proposes Property-Aware Relation (PAR) Networks for few-shot molecular property prediction, combining property-aware embeddings and adaptive relation graph learning to tailor molecular relations to specific properties. A meta-learning strategy selectively updates parameters to balance generic and property-specific knowledge.
