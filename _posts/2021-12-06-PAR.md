In this paper, we propose Property-Aware Relation (PAR) Networks to address the few-shot learning problem in molecular property prediction. 
We introduce a property-aware embedding function and an adaptive relation graph learning module, enabling the joint estimation of 
molecular relation graphs tailored to specific properties.
