Drug discovery relies on predicting molecular properties—but what if you only have a handful of examples? Traditional methods fail here. Our Property-Aware Relation (PAR) Networks learn to adapt molecular relationships based on which property you're predicting. A clever meta-learning strategy balances general chemistry knowledge with property-specific patterns. The result: accurate predictions from minimal data, accelerating early-stage drug discovery.
