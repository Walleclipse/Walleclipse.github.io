Can reinforcement learning master the chaos of optical systems? We built a simulation environment to find out. Real optical control is brutal—nonconvex, nonlinear, and plagued by time-dependent noise—yet traditional controllers struggle. Our environment captures these challenges faithfully, providing a testbed where RL algorithms can be benchmarked, compared, and improved for real-world laser control applications.
