In this paper, we develop an optical simulation environment tailored for reinforcement learning-based controllers. 
This environment accurately models the nonconvexity, nonlinearity, and time-dependent noise characteristic of optical systems, 
providing a realistic testing ground. 
Additionally, we present benchmark results for various reinforcement learning algorithms within the proposed simulation environment.
