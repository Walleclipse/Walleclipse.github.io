We introduce BioSLAM, a lifelong SLAM framework designed to incrementally learn new appearances while maintaining accurate place recognition for previously visited areas. 
BioSLAM incorporates a novel dual-memory mechanism: (1) a dynamic memory for efficiently learning new observations and (2) a static memory 
for balancing new and old knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, BioSLAM is the first memory-enhanced lifelong SLAM system tailored to 
support incremental place recognition in long-term navigation tasks.
