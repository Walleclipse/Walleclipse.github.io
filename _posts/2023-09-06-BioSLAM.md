Humans navigate familiar places effortlessly while still learning new ones—why can't robots? BioSLAM brings this capability to visual place recognition through a brain-inspired dual-memory system. Dynamic memory rapidly encodes new observations; static memory consolidates them without erasing what came before. The result is the first SLAM system that genuinely supports lifelong learning, enabling robots to navigate for months or years without "forgetting" previously visited places.
