The challenge of the generalization gap between training and test sets highlights the need for online adaptation algorithms to update prediction models in real time. 
Drawing inspiration from the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), this paper presents a suite of online adaptation methods 
specifically designed for neural network-based models.
