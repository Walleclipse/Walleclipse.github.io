Cardiogenic shock (CS) affects up to 50,000 people annually in the United States, with high in-hospital mortality rates of 40%-67%. 
About 18.6% of CS survivors are re-admitted. This study aims to predict 7-day and 30-day readmissions in CS patients using machine learning 
(ML) algorithms to guide targeted interventions and improve healthcare outcomes.
