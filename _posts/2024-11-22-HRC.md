In this paper, we present a novel multimodal and hierarchical framework designed to enable efficient and robust long-term 
human-robot collaboration (HRC). The proposed framework seamlessly integrates visual observations with speech commands, 
facilitating intuitive, natural, and flexible interactions between humans and robots. We deploy the framework on the KINOVA GEN3 robot 
and conduct extensive user studies through real-world long-term HRC experiments.
