In this project, we introduce WeHelp, a shared autonomy system designed to assist wheelchair users. 
The WeHelp system features three operational modes: following mode, remote control mode, and teleoperation mode. 
In following mode, the robot autonomously tracks and follows the wheelchair user using visual tracking technology. 
When the user requests assistance, the system utilizes speech recognition to interpret the command and seamlessly transitions 
to either remote control mode or teleoperation mode.
