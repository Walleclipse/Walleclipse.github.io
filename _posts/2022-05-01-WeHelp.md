Wheelchairs should adapt to users, not the other way around. WeHelp is a shared autonomy system we built for wheelchair users, offering three seamless modes: autonomous following using visual tracking (just walk and the chair follows), plus voice-activated remote control and teleoperation for tighter spaces or specific needs. Built to make mobility more accessible and dignified.
