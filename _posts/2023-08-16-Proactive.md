This paper presents an integrated framework for proactive HRC. A robust intention prediction module, which leverages prior task information and 
human-in-the-loop training, is learned to guide the robot for efficient collaboration. The proposed framework also uses robust safe control 
to ensure interactive safety under uncertainty. The developed framework is applied to a co-assembly task using a Kinova Gen3 robot.
