We propose a method that constructs a Koopman operator using object features predicted by a trained feature extractor from image, 
which is then employed to auto-regressively advance system states. The feature extractor is designed to embed scene information into object 
features, enabling precise propagation of robot trajectories. Our results demonstrate that this approach maintains high task success 
rates using learned features and extends its applicability to real-world manipulation tasks without relying on ground-truth object states.
