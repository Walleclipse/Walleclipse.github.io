This project introduces a user-friendly platform for simulating pulse evolution in optical fibers. 
It offers a comprehensive set of features for representing laser pulses, modeling fiber characteristics, 
and simulating nonlinear processes such as four-wave mixing and supercontinuum generation. The package is complemented by a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), 
making it accessible for users at all experience levels.
