Understanding ultrafast optics shouldn't require a physics PhD. I built a user-friendly Python toolkit with a graphical interface for simulating how laser pulses evolve through optical fibers. From basic pulse propagation to complex nonlinear effects like four-wave mixing and supercontinuum generation—all accessible whether you're an expert or just getting started.
