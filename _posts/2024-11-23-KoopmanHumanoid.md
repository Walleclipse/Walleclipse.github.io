This paper presents a continual learning algorithm for iteratively refining Koopman dynamics in high-dimensional legged robots. The method ensures monotonic convergence of linear approximation error and achieves high control performance on Unitree and ANYmal robots across diverse terrains with linear MPC controllers.
