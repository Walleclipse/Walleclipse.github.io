This paper propose a continual learning algorithm designed to iteratively refine Koopman dynamics for high-dimensional legged robots. 
Theoretical analysis shows that the linear approximation error of our method converges monotonically. Experimental results demonstrate that 
our method achieves high control performance on robots like Unitree G1/H1/A1/Go2 and ANYmal D, across various terrains using linear MPC controllers.
