Everyone assumed Vision Transformers need massive datasets—we proved them wrong. By rethinking model size and tokenization, our Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) achieves 98% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using just 3.7M parameters. That's better than other transformers and rivals ResNet at a fraction of the size. The takeaway: with the right architecture choices, transformers can thrive on small data too.
