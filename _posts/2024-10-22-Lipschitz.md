This paper investigates the robustness of neural networks in perception systems, specifically examining their sensitivity to targeted, small-scale perturbations. 
We identify the Lipschitz constant as a key metric for quantifying and enhancing network robustness. We derive an analytical expression to compute the Lipschitz constant 
based on neural network architecture, providing a theoretical basis for estimating and improving robustness.
