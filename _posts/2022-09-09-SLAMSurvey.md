How do you build robots that can localize themselves for years, not just hours? This survey maps the landscape of long-term place recognition—the algorithms, the challenges, and the opportunities. Whether you're new to SLAM or pushing the frontier, this serves as both tutorial and research roadmap for achieving real-world, long-term robotic autonomy.
