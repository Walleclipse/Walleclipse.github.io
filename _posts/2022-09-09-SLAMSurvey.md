In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art methods for long-term localization, highlighting key advancements and 
exploring future directions and opportunities in the field. This paper serves as both a tutorial for researchers new to the place recognition 
community and a valuable resource for those interested in advancing long-term robotics autonomy.
