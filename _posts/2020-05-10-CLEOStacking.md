Pulse and beam combination has become the preferred approach for achieving high pulse energy in lasers. 
We demonstrate the coherent stacking of 128 pulses from a 0.95 GHz repetition rate femtosecond Yb:fiber laser using a delay line 
and polarization control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of successfully stacking 128 ultrashort pulses.
