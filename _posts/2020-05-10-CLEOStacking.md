High-power lasers require combining many weak pulses into one powerful burst—but maintaining coherence is fiendishly difficult. We achieved the first-ever coherent stacking of 128 ultrashort pulses from a GHz-rate femtosecond fiber laser using precisely controlled delay lines and polarization. A milestone in pushing the boundaries of laser pulse combination.
