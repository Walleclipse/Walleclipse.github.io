For robots to work safely alongside humans, they need to predict what we'll do next. We developed a multi-task model that simultaneously forecasts human trajectories and intentions—and crucially, adapts quickly to new situations. The model's flexibility makes it practical for real human-robot collaboration, where conditions change constantly and safety is paramount.
