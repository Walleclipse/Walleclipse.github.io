This work presents an efficient pipeline for text recognition in noisy, blurry images by combining CTPN with DenseNet for detection and recognition. Fuzzy matching aligns detected text with a predefined library for refined results.

[//]: # (Our method achieves an 83% accuracy on highly noisy datasets, with a 97% approximate accuracy for cases where the edit distance is less than 3.)
