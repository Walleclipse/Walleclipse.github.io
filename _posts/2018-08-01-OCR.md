Reading text from blurry, noisy photos of real documents is surprisingly hard for computers. We built a practical pipeline combining CTPN detection with DenseNet recognition, plus fuzzy matching to map detected text to a known library. The system handles the messy reality of photographed documents where perfect scans aren't available.
