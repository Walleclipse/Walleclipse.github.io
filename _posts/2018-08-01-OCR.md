In this work, we propose an efficient pipeline for recognizing text in extremely noisy and blurry photographed images. By integrating the Connectionist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) with DenseNet, we design an initial step for text detection and recognition. 
Subsequently, we apply fuzzy matching to align the detected text with a predefined library, enabling further refinement of the results.
