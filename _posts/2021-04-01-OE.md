To achieve fast and robust optical control for coherent pulse stacking, we integrated the stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) method 
with the reinforcement learning algorithm soft actor-critic (SAC), forming a powerful hybrid algorithm, SAC-SPGDM. 
Simulations demonstrate that this algorithm effectively controls the optical system, enabling the coherent stacking of 128 pulses.
