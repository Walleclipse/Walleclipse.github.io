Coherent pulse stacking can boost laser power dramatically, but controlling it is a nightmare—the system is nonlinear, noisy, and hard to optimize. We combined the best of two approaches: stochastic gradient descent for speed and soft actor-critic reinforcement learning for robustness. Our hybrid SAC-SPGDM algorithm successfully stacks 128 pulses in simulation, pointing toward more powerful and stable laser systems.
